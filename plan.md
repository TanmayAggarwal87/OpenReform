# Decentralized Petition-to-Action Platform — 36h Hackathon Plan

## 1) Project Summary
A decentralized petition-to-action platform on Ethereum testnet (prefer Sepolia) that lets supporters fund petitions into escrow with milestone-based payouts to implementers. Petition content and proofs live on IPFS, and an indexer-driven timeline shows progress from creation to payouts.

## 2) High-level Demo Story (2–3 minutes)
Create a petition with IPFS-hosted content and on-chain CID, support and fund it from multiple wallets, an implementer accepts and submits milestone proofs, an attestor approves and releases escrowed payouts, and the UI timeline updates via the indexer API (fallback to direct chain reads if needed).

## 3) Repo / Folder Structure
```
/contracts          # Hardhat project, Solidity, tests, deployment scripts
/indexer-api        # Event indexer + API + IPFS pinning helpers
/frontend           # Next.js dApp using wagmi + viem
/shared             # Shared ABIs, types, constants, event schemas
```

## 5) Integration Contracts

### Smart Contract Events (required by indexer)
Event names and fields to finalize in contracts and `/shared/event-schema`:
- PetitionCreated(petitionId, creator, contentCID, timestamp)
- Supported(petitionId, supporter, timestamp)
- Funded(petitionId, funder, amount, timestamp)
- ImplementerAccepted(petitionId, implementer, profileCID, timestamp)
- MilestoneSubmitted(petitionId, milestoneIndex, proofCID, timestamp)
- MilestoneApproved(petitionId, milestoneIndex, approver, timestamp)
- PayoutReleased(petitionId, milestoneIndex, amount, implementer, timestamp)
- RefundsClaimed(petitionId, claimant, amount, timestamp)

Note: Exact event signatures must be confirmed against contract implementation.

### ABI Sharing Procedure
- Compile artifacts in `/contracts`.
- Export ABI JSON to `/shared/abis`.
- Frontend and indexer import ABIs from `/shared/abis`.
- Update ABIs on each contract change; verify by re-running compile.

### API Endpoints Required by Frontend
- `GET /api/petitions` → list of petitions
  - fields: petitionId, title, contentCID, status, totalFunded, supporterCount, timestamps
- `GET /api/petitions/:id` → petition detail
  - fields: petitionId, contentCID, status, milestones[], implementer, fundingStatus
- `GET /api/petitions/:id/timeline` → ordered events
  - fields: type, petitionId, actor, amount, cid, timestamp, txHash
- `POST /api/ipfs/pin` → pin content/proof
  - fields: cid (return), provider, timestamp

Note: Exact response fields must be verified and aligned with frontend needs.

### Shared Constants
- `chainId` (Sepolia) — verify from official Ethereum docs.
- Contract addresses — set after deployment, stored in `/shared/constants`.
- IPFS gateway pattern — choose provider gateway and verify docs.

## 6) Timeline Plan (36 hours)

- All: End-to-end demo polish, minimum demo page, fallback modes.
- Person A: Deploy to Sepolia, update `/shared/constants`.
- Person B: Stabilize indexer; fallback instructions.
- Person C: Demo script and UI polish.

Final checkpoint: 2–3 minute demo success.

## 7) Security + Safety Checklist (MVP-level)
- Escrow safety: Use reentrancy guards where applicable; prefer pull payments; enforce access control for approvals.
- Access control: Attestor/admin restricted to approvals; implementer restrictions for milestone submissions.
- Key handling: Use `.env` for private keys; never commit secrets.
- Content moderation stance: No deletion; optionally hide content in UI via visibility gating for hackathon demo.

## 8) Risk Register + Fallbacks
- IPFS pinning fails: Fallback to local JSON + hashes; display as unverified.
- Indexer unstable: Fallback to frontend direct event reads.
- Approvals/disputes too hard: Fallback to team multisig/admin as attestor.

## 9) Questions / Decisions Needed
- Token choice: ETH-only escrow or ERC20 support?
- Approval model: single admin, multisig, or simple DAO vote?
- Petition thresholds: support-only, funding-only, or both?
- Any hackathon constraints discovered in official docs (RPC limits, demo requirements)?
- IPFS pinning provider selection (Pinata vs web3.storage vs others)?
